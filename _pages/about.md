Hi all !

I am a post-doctoral researcher investigating how urbanization affects wildlife and its evolution. In particular I'm interested in understanding:
- how urbanization shapes evolutionary trajectories of urban dwelling species, both regarding adaptive and non adaptive processes.
- what are the main urban environemental factors affecting species phenotypes and evolution through time, and how they do so.
- if the similitude of urban environments accross the planet is leading to parallel evolution in cities.

To answer these question I use both theoritical and empirical approaches, involving several types of data, from long term phenotypical database to worldwide genomic datasets. I am alway looking forward to learn new methods and approaches from multiples fields of Evolutionary Ecology, such as quantitative genetics, genomics, modelling, behavioural ecology, epidemiology... And I can't wait to see what my next frontier will be!

I am currently a postdoc at the University of Toronto Mississauga in [Marc T.J. Johnson](https://evoecolab.wordpress.com/)'s and [Rob Ness](https://ness.bio/)' labs. My current project aims to understand how urbanization affects populations neutral evolution and demography, both empirically and theoritically. I work on the GLobal Urban Evolution project [(GLUE)](https://www.globalurbanevolution.com/) on White clover (_Trifolium repens L._) genomics.

Before that, I completed my PhD in 2021 under the supervision of [Anne Charmantier](https://annecharmantier.weebly.com/) and [Arnaud Gr√©goire](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/ee/esp/777-c/154-arnaud-gregoire) at the [CEFE](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/) in Montpellier, France. During my PhD, I studied how urbanization was leading to various phenotypic changes in the Great tit (_Parus major L._), from morphology and life history traits to behaviour, and if such changes were the result of natural selection. I also investigated parallelism in genomic and epigenomics shifts linked with urbanization.
