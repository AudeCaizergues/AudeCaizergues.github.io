I'm an evolutionary biologist mainly interest in understanding how urbanisation affects wild species and their evolution. In particular I focus on:
- how urbanization shapes evolutionary trajectories of urban dwelling species, both regarding adaptive and non adaptive processes.
- what are the main urban environmental factors affecting species phenotypes and evolution through time, and how they do so.
- if the similitude of urban environments accross the planet is leading to parallel evolution in cities.

To answer these questions I use both theoritical and empirical approaches, involving several types of data, from long term phenotypical database to worldwide genomic datasets. I am always looking forward to learning new methods and approaches from multiples fields of Evolutionary Ecology, such as quantitative genetics, genomics, modelling, behavioural ecology, epidemiology... And I can't wait to see what my next frontier will be!
